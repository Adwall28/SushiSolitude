# OpenGLTesting

This is an experience I made for my Coursework 2 Assignment. It's not very good, but it shows a very basic experience of OpenGL. My idea was to have a relaxing ushsi experience, but it did'nt quite turn out how i wnated it too with me struggling to get assimp to work. However, even after I have uploaded the coursework, I think I will carry on trying to use OpenGL as I have found it interesting to learn.
